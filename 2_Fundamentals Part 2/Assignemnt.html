        // Assignment 

        /*  To give you a good bit of practice, we have created some replit.com exercises for you to play with. 
            We believe that it’s best to practice programming on your own computer, rather than in an online environment, but we’ll get to that soon enough.

            Be sure to do the lessons in order presented here. 
            Pressing “run” at the top will run the code. Read all directions, watch the terminal, and read all the errors. 
            Don’t forget to use ‘console.log’ extensively.  */
