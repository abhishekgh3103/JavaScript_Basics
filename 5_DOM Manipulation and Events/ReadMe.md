#DOM Manipulation and Events

#DOM

    Here in this module I learnt about the DOM (Document Object Model)
    Difference between element and node 
    difference between elementlist, nodelist and array
    difference between innerHTML and textContent
    Also learnt about script loading strategies

#Event

    Here I learnt about three types/ways to use events 
    1. using onClick inline in html
    2. using onClick in js file
    3. using addEventListener in js file
    Attaching listeners to a group of nodes
    forEach can be used to iterate over the group of nodes
